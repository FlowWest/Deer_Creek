#make a table

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
# extract a subset of the mtcars data
df <- mtcars %>%
    mutate(make_model = row.names(mtcars)) %>%
    filter(cyl == 4) %>%    
    select(make_model, mpg, wt) %>%
    mutate(wt = wt*1000) %>%
    arrange(make_model) 
    
```


```{r setup, include=FALSE}

## R Markdown
Something stupid for Anna
covfefer
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
